# ece470: AI Project
This is a project programming an Artificial Intelligence using Machine Learning to create a model for our data.
We are using data regarding [echocardiograms](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Echocardiogram).

## Machine Learning
The machine learning aspects includes linear regression and the creation and testing of a model that is used to learn the data.

## AI
The AI for this project includes a crossover and mutation from the parents to produce an offspring.

The crossover is a simple switch between two of the features.

The mutation is a simple bit flip of a randomly selected feature.
